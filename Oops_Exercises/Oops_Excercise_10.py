# Calculate the area of different shapes using OOP
# Given:
#
# You have given a Shape class and subclasses Circle  and Square. The parent class (Shape) has a area() method.
#
# Now, Write a OOP code to calculate the area of each shapes (each subclass must write its own implementation of area() method to calculates its area).
#
# Use the following code
#
# class Shape:
#     def area(self):
#         raise NotImplementedError("Area method must be implemented by subclasses")
#
# class Circle(Shape):
#     def __init__(self, radius):
#         self.radius = radius
#
# class Square(Shape):
#     def __init__(self, side):
#         self.side = side
#
# # Example of polymorphism
# shapes = [Circle(5), Square(7), Circle(3)]
#
# for shape in shapes:
#     print(shape.area())  # Output: 78.53975, 49, 28.27431

class Shape:
    def area(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Area method must be implemented by subclasses")
