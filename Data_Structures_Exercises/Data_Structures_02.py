# Remove and add item in a list
# Write a program to remove the item present at index 4 and add it to the 2nd position and at the end of the list.
#
# Given:

# list1 = [34, 54, 67, 89, 11, 43, 94]
# Expected Output:
#
# List After removing element at index 4  [34, 54, 67, 89, 43, 94]
# List after Adding element at index 2  [34, 54, 11, 67, 89, 43, 94]
# List after Adding element at last  [34, 54, 11, 67, 89, 43, 94, 11]
