# Intersection of Sets
# Find the intersection of set1 and set2. Write a code to return a new set containing only the elements that are common to both set1 and set2
#
# Given:
#
# set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
# set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
# Expected Output:
#
# {40, 50, 30}

set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}

print(set1.intersection(set2))
