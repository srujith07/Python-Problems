# Symmetric Difference
# Find the symmetric difference of set1 and set2. Write a code to returns a new set containing elements that are unique to either set1 or set2, but not in both. Itâ€™s like finding the union and then removing the intersection.
#
# Given:
#
# set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
# set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
# Expected Output:
#
# {20, 70, 10, 60}

set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}

print(set1.symmetric_difference(set2))
